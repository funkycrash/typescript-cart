Self assignment to practice TypeScript


## Assignment
I wanted to practice my typeScript skills as well as yourmy ability to design and implement a web application from scratch. So I imagined the following assignment.

**Project: Online Shopping Cart**

Description: You are tasked with building an online shopping cart application using TypeScript. The application should allow users to browse a list of products, add products to a cart, remove products from the cart, and place an order.

**Requirements:**

1. The application should have a product catalog page that displays a list of products with their name, description, and price.
2. Users should be able to add products to a cart from the catalog page.
3. The cart should display the items added by the user, along with their quantities and total cost.
4. Users should be able to remove items from the cart.
5. The cart should update its contents and total cost automatically when items are added or removed.
6. Users should be able to place an order from the cart page.
7. The application should use TypeScript for all code, including the frontend and backend.

**Deliverables:**

1. A functional online shopping cart application built with TypeScript.
2. A document explaining the architecture and design of the application, including a list of the technologies used and the rationale for their selection.
3. A document describing the testing strategy used for the application, including a list of the tests performed and their results.
